# Tiffany README

## Introduction
Tiffany is a command line helper which aims at generating commands that are used frequently.

## Why the project is named Tiffany?
Tiffany is the name of the staff that I encounted at Apple Store when I brought my iPad Pro.
She was introducing the product in an enthusiastic, courteous and articulate manner.
I was surprised when she wrote her name on my receipt.
If you know girls from Hong Kong, you surely know that some of them behave not very nicely.
Worse still, they love names such as Tiffany which is one of the most widely used names in Hong Kong.
I consider this to be an inaccurate description.
I sincerely hope that you will enjoyu using the helper.
